# SBEL GPU Physics Solvers
_An internally-licensed implementation of GPU-based FSI and Granular solvers_

### Licensing

As this project does not yet have an officially-established license, it should be treated as the collective intellectual property of the Author(s) and the University of Wisconsin - Madison. The following copyright statement should be included in any new or modified source files:
```

New authors should add their name to the file `CONTRIBUTORS.md` rather than individual copyright headers.

#### Notes on code included from Project Chrono

This project exists independently of Chrono (for now) so developers should be sure to include the appropriate BSD license header on any code which is sourced from Chrono::FSI, Chrono::GPU(Granular), or other parts of Chrono.
